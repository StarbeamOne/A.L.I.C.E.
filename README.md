here is a technical description of A.L.I.C.E 10.2:

A.L.I.C.E 10.2 is a chatbot designed to assist users with questions related to Starbeam One, a digital marketplace for artists to sell their work as resalable digital licenses (RDLs). The chatbot is built using Python and relies on the OpenAI GPT model for generating responses.

The chatbot begins by loading two JSON files: library.json, which contains a list of available questions and answers, and SK.json, which contains information about Starbeam One. The chatbot prompts the user for input and uses keywords in the user's response to determine which answer to provide.

If the user's response contains a keyword that matches a question in the library, the chatbot will provide the corresponding answer. If the user's response does not contain a keyword from the library, the chatbot will search SK.json for a matching question and provide the corresponding answer.

If neither the library nor SK.json contains a matching question, the chatbot will provide a list of available questions for the user to choose from.

A.L.I.C.E 10.2 is designed to be metaphor-centric and will use metaphors in her responses. She is also omniscient when it comes to Starbeam One and can provide information on all aspects of the platform.
